#Below is a big paragraph of text about the Lakers 2020 season from https://www.lineups.com/nba/roster/los-angeles-lakers

'''
The Lakers went all in this offseason 
and swung a deal for former Pelicans forward Anthony Davis. 
They sent a package of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, 
and 3 first-round picks to New Orleans to land Davis. 
Those three have made good developments with the Pelicans, especially Brandon Ingram. 
But, the deal is still a huge win for the Lakers as Lebron, Davis, 
and company have put together an incredible season. 
Los Angeles has ridden James and Davis, 
along with a supporting cast built around them, 
to the second-best record in the NBA. 
The Lakers ended the season atop the Western Conference with a record of 49-14. 
They were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league. 
Davis proved to the final piece necessary for the Lakers to 
rebound from missing the playoffís last year. 
Los Angeles was a dominant club on both sides of the ball 
and are in a position to have another successful year next season.
